# FlashApp

In my spare time I do a lot of film photography, where obviously you can't check your images straight away in order to tell if they have come out or not. Normally, this is fine because the camera has a built in light meter telling you the exposure level. However, if you use a flash with your film camera then itdoesn't work!

This is an app used to calculate settings on your camera in order to get the correct exposure for your picture using the [guide number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guide_number) of your flash.

It takes into account the ISO of the film you're using and the guide number of your flash and then can either calculate the distance you should stand from your subject to expose correctly given your camera aperture or vise versa.
