GN = distance × f-number

http://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/16850/what-is-the-quantative-relation-between-flash-guide-number-and-iso

Guide Number = (Shooting Distance × f-number) ÷ ISO factor

Needed is the guide number for the flash (mine is 38).

ISO is related to sensitivity in that each stop in increased ISO is the same as 
a single stop of increased aperture. 

Look up table for ISO

ISO		Factor
100		1
200		1.4
400 	2
800 	2.8
1600 	4
3200 	5.6

Important facts:

If we go from f/1.4 to f/2.8 then we have increased the area by four times as
much (think of this as a square)

If you multiply your distance from a light source by X, the amount of light 
reaching you will drop by a factor of X^2 (X squared)

Halving flash power decreases GN by factor sqrt(2)

the square root of (200/100) is 1.4 
the square root of (400/100) is 2 
the square root of (800/100) is 2.8
